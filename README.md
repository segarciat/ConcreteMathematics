# Concrete Mathematics

In this repository, I track my self-study journey through the book *Concrete Mathematics: A Foundation for Computer Science*, by Graham, Knuth, and Patashnik (2nd Edition). I use TeX to typeset my work, so you will find TeX files, the compiled PDFs, and any images I have included. I take no credit for any of the images, lest I've drawn them.
